## Open Roles
The following volunteer positions are open (as of last update):-
- **Event Management** - Help us manage the workings of the event: From welcoming the attendees and speakers to making sure the stage is all set. You are responsible for making sure the entire event goes by without a hiccup.
- **Graphic Design** - From designing the attendee ID cards to the roll-down poster at the venue . You are the person behind what everyone sees. Make your designs worth it!
- **Sponsorship** - No event is complete without money. And we need sponsors for getting that much-needed cash. You help us get sponsors and meet our financial costs. The more sponsorship you get, the better the event will be!
- **Speakers** - You know what's the most important thing at an event? Speakers! No event is complete without good speakers. You help us look for and contact the best speakers in town to speak at our event.

- **Promotions** - Attendees are the heart of the event. You are responsible for spreading word about our event across the city.

- **Discipline and Security** - You know what happens when 200 odd youths gather together. You are responsible for making sure all attendees are registered properly, are carrying valid ID, kicking out any unfortunate rogue attendees and making sure people only enter areas where they are supposed to.
